🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning (MNIST)

This project demonstrates a deep learning model trained to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

✨ Overview
Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

Model: Deep Neural Network (DNN) / Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Input: 28x28 grayscale images of digits 0–9

Output: Predicted digit (0–9)

Accuracy: ~98% on the test set (depending on model config)
